## 1. Project Overview

**MatchUp** is a web-based **club ladder** system designed for tennis and padel clubs.
It provides a flexible, ongoing competition format where players (or doubles teams) **challenge opponents**, **schedule matches**, and **move up or down** the rankings based on match outcomes.

Instead of traditional tournament brackets, a ladder keeps all members engaged throughout the season — anyone can climb to the top by consistently winning challenges.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Challenge System** | Players challenge opponents within a configurable rank range on their ladder. |
| **Match Scheduling** | Teams set their weekly availability; the system facilitates scheduling within a configurable frequency window. |
| **ELO-based Rating** | After each match the winner gains rating points and the loser drops, keeping rankings dynamic and fair. |
| **Authentication** | Secure user registration and login with **JWT**-based tokens. |
| **Multi-sport Support** | Ladders can be created for different sports (tennis, padel, etc.) with configurable team sizes. |
| **Club Management** | Club admins manage members, create ladders, and oversee match disputes. |

### Core Entities

```

- **Users** — Registered players with a global ELO rating.
- **Clubs** — Organisations that host one or more ladders.
- **Ladders** — A ranked competition within a club for a specific sport.
- **Teams** — One or more players competing as a unit on a ladder.
- **Matches** — Scheduled challenges between two teams, tracked through statuses (`pending` → `confirmed` → `completed`).

## 4. Local Development — How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Node.js 22+** & **npm**
- **PostgreSQL 15+** running locally (or via Docker)

### 4.1 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd projectdatabases
```

### 4.2 Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:

```dotenv
DB_USER=app
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=matchup

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS=24
FLASK_DEBUG=true

MOCEAN_API_KEY=your_mocean_key
MOCEAN_API_SECRET=your_mocean_secret
MOCEAN_API_TOKEN=your_mocean_api_token
MOCEAN_SMS_URL=https://rest.moceanapi.com/rest/2/sms
MOCEAN_SENDER=MatchUp
```

`MOCEAN_API_TOKEN` is preferred for Bearer-token auth. The key/secret pair is
still supported as a fallback for older credential setups.

### 4.3 Set up the database

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL and create the database & role
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER app WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE matchup OWNER app;"
```

> The schema is applied automatically when the Flask app starts (`init_db()`).

### 4.4 Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The API will be available at **http://localhost:5000**.

### 4.5 Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server will be available at **http://localhost:5173**.
API calls to `/api/*` are automatically proxied to the backend.

### 4.6 Test the SMS API

Once you have an admin JWT, you can test Mocean directly through the backend:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/test-sms \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number":"+32470000000","message":"MatchUp SMS test"}'
```

This endpoint is admin-only and is meant for verifying the SMS integration before
match reminders are wired to real match data.

## 5. Online Website

The production site is deployed on **Google Cloud Platform** and accessible at:

> **http://team5.ua-ppdb.com**

The deployment uses **Nginx** as a reverse proxy serving the Vite production build for the frontend and forwarding `/api/` requests to **Gunicorn** (3 workers) over a Unix socket.
